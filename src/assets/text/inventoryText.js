       title: "Where is water being bottled?",
       paragraph1: "There are many types of beverage-bottling facilities: bottled water facilities, breweries, distilleries, ice facilities, soft drink manufacturing plants, and wineries. What do all these facilities have in common? <b>They all use water.</b>",
       paragraph2: "Bottled water alone (meaning, not part of another beverage) is an important subset of all bottling facilities. The bottled water industry estimates that the United States consumed 15 billion gallons (57 billion liters) of bottled water in 2020 (International Bottled Water Association). That's 45.2 gallons of bottled water per person, or 342 standard bottles of water.",
       paragraph3: "Although there are estimates for bottled water consumption, national datasets about how much water is withdrawn from groundwater, surface water, and springs for bottled water and other beverages are limited. Water withdrawals for bottling are not federally regulated (unlike the <a href='https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/bottled-water-everywhere-keeping-it-safe' target='_blank'>quality of bottled drinking water</a>, which is regulated). Both voluntary and mandatory reporting of water use varies from state to state, and some states cannot share withdrawal data for beverage-bottling or other categories of water use. Without these data, we cannot accurately assess bottled water influence on the water cycle locally, regionally, or nationally.",
       paragraph4: "To help fill this gap, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) <a href='https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/withdrawals-bottled-water' target='_blank'>Water Mission Area's Bottled Water Assessment project</a> conducted an inventory of bottling facilities across the United States, with a main focus on bottled water (Buchwald and others, 2023).",
