       title: "What do we know about bottled water facilities?",
       paragraph1: "Let’s take a closer look at where <b>bottled water facilities</b> in particular are getting their water and how much water they're using.",
       paragraph2: "Most bottled water facilities nationwide source their water from public supply. However, the proportion of bottled water facilities using different water sources varies by county. In some counties, most bottled water facilities use self-supply water. In others, most facilities use a combination of sources.",
       paragraph3: "Remember how few bottling facilities we were able to acquire water use data for? Well, most facilities that we <em>do</em> have water use data for are bottled water facilities. Although the primary source of water for all bottled water facilities is public supply, the primary source of water for <b>bottled water facilities with available water use data</b> is self-supply from groundwater wells, springs, and surface water intakes. This difference stems from the fact that facilities that use self-supply water are more likely to be required to report to state or local agencies how much water they’re withdrawing from the local environment. Water use data for public-supply deliveries to specific customers (such as bottled water facilities) are not as consistently available.",
       paragraph4: "Based on limited available data from 1969 through 2022 (Buchwald and others, 2023), we estimate that average annual water use at bottled water facilities ranges from less than 0.1 million gallons per day (MGD) to more than 1.5 MGD.",
       paragraph5: "These estimates are a big step forward in understanding how much water bottled water facilities are using and where they are sourcing their water, but there is still a lot to learn. USGS science will continue to improve our understanding of the impacts of bottled water on the water cycle locally, regionally, and across the entire nation."
