       title: "What do we know about bottled water facilities?",
       paragraph1: "Let’s take a closer look at where <b>bottled water facilities</b> in particular are getting their water and how much water they're using.",
       paragraph2: "Most bottled water facilities nationwide source their water from public supply. However, the proportion of bottled water facilities using different water sources varies by county. In some counties, most bottled water facilities use self-supply water. In others, most facilities use a combination of sources.",
       paragraph3: "Remember how few bottling facilities have water use data? Well, most facilities that <em>do</em> have water use data are bottled water facilities. The sources of water for these facilities with water use data varies, with the largest proportion (39%) using water from wells. This breakdown of water sources is different from the breakdown for all bottled water facilities, because facilities that use self-supply water are more likely to report how much water they’re withdrawing from the local environment.",
       paragraph4: "Based on limited available data from 1969 through 2022 (Buchwald and others, 2023), we estimate that annual water use at bottled water facilities ranges from less than 0.1 million gallons per day (MGD) to more than 1.5 MGD.",
       paragraph5: "These estimates are a big step forward in understanding how much water bottled water facilities are using and where they are sourcing their water, but there is still a lot to learn. USGS science will continue to improve our understanding of the impacts of bottled water on the water cycle locally, regionally, and across the entire nation."
