       title1: "What do we know about bottled water facilities?",
       paragraph1: "Let’s take a closer look at where <b>bottled water facilities</b> in particular are getting their water and how much water they're using.",
       paragraph2: "Most bottled water facilities nationwide source their water from public supply. However, the proportion of bottled water facilities using different water sources varies by county. In some counties, most bottled water facilities use a single source of self-supply water. In others, most bottled water facilities use a combination of sources.",
       paragraph3: "Remember how few bottling facilities we were able to acquire water use data for? Well, most facilities that we <em>do</em> have water use data for are bottled water facilities. Although the primary source of water for all bottled water facilities is public supply, the primary source of water for <b>bottled water facilities with available water use data</b> is self-supply from groundwater wells, springs, and surface water intakes. This difference stems from the fact that facilities that use self-supply water are more likely to be required to report to state or local agencies how much water they’re withdrawing from the local environment. Water use data for public-supply deliveries to specific customers (such as bottled water facilities) are not as consistently available.",
       paragraph4: "So how much water are each of these 151 bottled water facilities using? There are limited available water use data from 1969 through 2022 for this subset of facilities (Buchwald and others, 2023). In some cases the withdrawal amount was metered or reported, while in others the withdrawal amount was estimated based on a permitted value or pump capacity. Based on these data, average annual water use at bottled water facilities for which water use data were acquired ranges from less than 0.1 million gallons per day (MGD) to more than 1.5 MGD.",
       title2: "What comes next?",
       paragraph5: "These estimates are a big step forward in understanding how much water bottled water facilities are using and where they are sourcing their water, but there is still a lot to learn. The USGS <a href='https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/withdrawals-bottled-water' target='_blank'>Water Mission Area's Bottled Water Assessment project</a> will continue to improve our understanding of the impacts of bottled water on the water cycle locally, regionally, and across the entire nation. The next phase of the project includes regional assessments of withdrawals for water bottling and changes to local groundwater levels, spring flow, water quality, and other conditions. The project team will also complete a national synthesis to identify relationships between socioeconomic conditions, water availability, ecosystems, and locations of bottling facilities."
