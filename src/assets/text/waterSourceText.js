       title: "Where are bottling facilities sourcing their water?",
       paragraph1: "Beverage-bottling facilities get water through public supply (water withdrawn by a water supplier and delivered to many users) or self-supply (water withdrawn from a private source for private use). In each case, the water can be sourced from several different pools of the water cycle, like groundwater, surface water, or springs.",
       paragraph2: "Data on water sources by bottling facility are limited. [DATA RELEASE] et al. 2023 performed new mapping analyses to infer the source of water to bottling facilities. These analyses make some assumptions, like assuming that a facility near a well uses that well to source their water, and a facility within a public-supply zone uses public-supply water. Although this is an estimate, it improves the nations's understanding of where bottling facilities are sourcing their water. The charts below show the primary source of water for bottling facilities in each state.",
       subtitle1: "Where do different facility types source water?",
       paragraph3: "Let's look more closely at bottled water facilities specifically. How does the source for bottled water facilities vary by county?"
