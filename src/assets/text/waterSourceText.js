       title: "Where are bottling facilities sourcing their water?",
       paragraph1: "Beverage-bottling facilities get water through public supply (water withdrawn by a water supplier and delivered to many users; USGS, 2019) or self-supply (water withdrawn from a private source for private use; USGS, 2019). In each case, the water can be sourced from several different pools of the water cycle, like groundwater, surface water, or springs.",
       paragraph2: "Data on water sources by bottling facility are limited. The USGS <a href='https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/withdrawals-bottled-water' target='_blank'>Bottled Water Assessment project</a> performed new mapping analyses to infer the source of water to bottling facilities. These analyses make some assumptions, like assuming that a facility near a well uses that well to source their water, and a facility within a public-supply zone uses public-supply water. Although this inferred information is an estimate, it improves the nation's understanding of where bottling facilities are sourcing their water."
