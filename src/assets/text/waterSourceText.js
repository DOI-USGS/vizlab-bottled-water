       title: "Where are bottling facilities sourcing their water?",
       paragraph1: "Beverage-bottling facilities get water through public supply (water withdrawn by a water supplier and delivered to many users) or self-supply (water withdrawn from a private source for private use). In each case, the water can be sourced from several different pools of the water cycle, like groundwater, surface water, or springs.",
       paragraph2: "Data on water sources by bottling facility are limited. The USGS <a href='https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/withdrawals-bottled-water' target='_blank'>Bottled Water Assessment project</a> performed new mapping analyses to infer the source of water to bottling facilities. These analyses make some assumptions, like assuming that a facility near a well uses that well to source their water, and a facility within a public-supply zone uses public-supply water. Although this inferred information is an estimate, it improves the nation's understanding of where bottling facilities are sourcing their water.",
       paragraph3: "Let's look more closely at <b>bottled water facilities</b>. Most bottled water facilities source their water from public supply. However, the proportion of bottled water facilities using different water sources varies by county. In some counties, most bottled water facilities use self-supply water. In others, most facilities use a combination of sources."
