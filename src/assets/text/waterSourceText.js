       title: "Where are bottling facilities sourcing their water?",
       paragraph1: "Beverage-bottling facilities withdraw water from a variety of sources. The two major categories of water supply are public supply and self-supply. Public-supply water is withdrawn by a water supplier and delivered to many users, while self-supply water is withdrawn from a private source for private use (USGS, 2019). In each case, the water can be sourced from several different pools of the water cycle, like groundwater, surface water, or springs. A facility may have a single supply of water, or may combine water from multiple sources. If a facility uses both self-supply well water and self-supply surface water, or uses a mixture of public-supply and self-supply water, that facility is said to source water from a 'combination of sources'.",
       paragraph2: "Data on water sources by bottling facility are limited. The USGS <a href='https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/withdrawals-bottled-water' target='_blank'>Bottled Water Assessment project</a> performed new mapping analyses to infer the source of water to bottling facilities. These analyses make some assumptions, like assuming that a facility near a well uses that well to source their water, and a facility within a public-supply water service area uses public-supply water. Although this inferred information is an estimate, it improves the nation's understanding of where bottling facilities are sourcing their water.",
       paragraph3: "The bar chart below shows where different types of facilities source water. Note that surface water intakes, springs, and groundwater wells can be sources for both public-supply and self-supply water, but are only quantified here as subsets of self-supply water."
