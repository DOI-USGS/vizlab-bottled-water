        title: "How much water are bottling facilities using?",
        paragraph1: "Acquiring water use data can be challenging. Some states do not require reporting of some types of water use. Other states require reporting to state or local agencies but cannot share site-specific withdrawals. For bottled water and other beverage facilities, the withdrawal amounts are sometimes below reporting thresholds, or the facilities purchase water from public-supply systems, and those data are not available. As a result, we have limited water use data for bottling facilities.",
        paragraph2: "Let's take another deep dive into bottled water facilities. Most facilities that do have water use data are bottled water facilities. Based on limited available data from 1969 through 2022 (Buchwald and others, 2023), we estimate that annual water use at bottled water facilities ranges from less than 0.1 million gallons per day (MGD) to more than 1.5 MGD. The sources of water for these facilities with water use data varies, with the largest proportion (40%) using water from wells."
