        paragraph1: "Acquiring water use data can be challenging. Some states do not require reporting of some types of water use. Other states require reporting to state or local agencies but cannot share site-specific withdrawals. For bottled water and other beverage facilities, the withdrawal amounts are sometimes below reporting thresholds, or the facilities purchase water from public-supply systems, and those data are not available. As a result, we have limited water use data for bottling facilities."
