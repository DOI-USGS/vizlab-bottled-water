        title: "How much water are bottling facilities using?",
        paragraph1: "Acquiring water use data can be challenging. Some states do not require reporting of some types of water use. Other states require reporting to state or local agencies, but cannot share site-specific withdrawals. For bottled water and other beverage facilities, the withdrawal amounts are sometimes below reporting thresholds, or the facilities purchase water from public supply systems, and those data are not available. As a result, we have limited water use data for bottling facilites.",
        subtitle1: "For how many inventoried bottling facilities does USGS have water use data?",
        subtitle2: "Where do bottled water facilities that have water use data source water?",
        paragraph2: "Using the available data, we can take a closer look at water use in bottled water facilities. Of the 0.6 percent of facilities that have available water use data, about 61 percent are bottled water facilities. Of those 147 bottled water facilities, 40 percent source water from wells, 25 percent from springs, 14 percent from public supply, and 19 percent from a combination of different sources.",
        paragraph3: "Among bottled water facilities with data, how much water is used, and how does that use vary by water source? This figure is based on limited available data from 1969 through 2022 (Buchwald and others, 2023)."
